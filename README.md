# Queue-simulator
## About :thought_balloon:
The application simulates a queue management system, which means that a series of randomly generated clients 
will be entering queues. They will be processed and then the clients will leave the queues after the service time is over.
## Features :white_check_mark:
- Friendly GUI for the user.
- Allows the user to set the parameters for the simulation.
- Errors will be shown when the user makes some mistake.
- Clients will be generated randomly based on user's input.
- Some results will be displayed at the end such as:
  - average waiting time for all queues
  - average service time for all queues
  - peak hour
